# `delete`

Delete your Worker and all associated Cloudflare developer platform resources.

```txt
wrangler delete [<SCRIPT>] [OPTIONS]
```

* `SCRIPT` string
  * The path to an entry point for your Worker. Only required if your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) does not include a `main` key (for example, `main = "index.js"`).
* `--name` string optional
  * Name of the Worker.
* `--env` string optional
  * Perform on a specific environment.
* `--dry-run` boolean (default: false) optional
  * Do not actually delete the Worker. This is useful for testing the output of `wrangler delete`.

The following global flags work on every command:

* `--help` boolean
  * Show help.
* `--config` string (not supported by Pages)
  * Path to your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).
* `--cwd` string
  * Run as if Wrangler was started in the specified directory instead of the current working directory.
