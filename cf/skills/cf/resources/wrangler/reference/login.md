# `login`

Authorize Wrangler with your Cloudflare account using OAuth. Wrangler will attempt to automatically open your web browser to login with your Cloudflare account.

If you prefer to use API tokens for authentication, such as in headless or continuous integration environments, refer to [Running Wrangler in CI/CD](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/).

```txt
wrangler login [OPTIONS]
```

* `--scopes-list` string optional
  * List all the available OAuth scopes with descriptions.
* `--scopes` string optional
  * Allows to choose your set of OAuth scopes. The set of scopes must be entered in a whitespace-separated list, for example, `npx wrangler login --scopes account:read user:read`.
* `--callback-host` string optional
  * Defaults to `localhost`. Sets the IP or hostname where Wrangler should listen for the OAuth callback.
* `--callback-port` string optional
  * Defaults to `8976`. Sets the port where Wrangler should listen for the OAuth callback.

Note

`wrangler login` uses all the available scopes by default if no flags are provided.

The following global flags work on every command:

* `--help` boolean
  * Show help.
* `--config` string (not supported by Pages)
  * Path to your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).
* `--cwd` string
  * Run as if Wrangler was started in the specified directory instead of the current working directory.

If Wrangler fails to open a browser, you can copy and paste the URL generated by `wrangler login` in your terminal into a browser and log in.

### Use `wrangler login` on a remote machine

If you are using Wrangler from a remote machine, but run the login flow from your local browser, you will receive the following error message after logging in:`This site can't be reached`.

To finish the login flow, run `wrangler login` and go through the login flow in the browser:

```sh
npx wrangler login
```

```sh
 ⛅️ wrangler 2.1.6
-------------------
Attempting to login via OAuth...
Opening a link in your default browser: https://dash.cloudflare.com/oauth2/auth?xyz...
```

The browser login flow will redirect you to a `localhost` URL on your machine.

Leave the login flow active. Open a second terminal session. In that second terminal session, use `curl` or an equivalent request library on the remote machine to fetch this `localhost` URL. Copy and paste the `localhost` URL that was generated during the `wrangler login` flow and run:

```sh
curl <LOCALHOST_URL>
```
