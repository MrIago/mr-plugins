## Usage

Workers - TypeScript

```ts
export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {


    // Can be a string or array of strings]
    const stories = [
      "This is a story about an orange cloud",
      "This is a story about a llama",
      "This is a story about a hugging emoji",
    ];


    const embeddings = await env.AI.run(
      "@cf/baai/bge-large-en-v1.5",
      {
        text: stories,
      }
    );


    return Response.json(embeddings);
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Python

```py
import os
import requests




ACCOUNT_ID = "your-account-id"
AUTH_TOKEN = os.environ.get("CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN")


stories = [
  'This is a story about an orange cloud',
  'This is a story about a llama',
  'This is a story about a hugging emoji'
]


response = requests.post(
  f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/run/@cf/baai/bge-large-en-v1.5",
  headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {AUTH_TOKEN}"},
  json={"text": stories}
)


print(response.json())
```

curl

```sh
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID/ai/run/@cf/baai/bge-large-en-v1.5  \
  -X POST  \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"  \
  -d '{ "text": ["This is a story about an orange cloud", "This is a story about a llama", "This is a story about a hugging emoji"] }'
```

OpenAI compatible endpoints

Workers AI also supports OpenAI compatible API endpoints for `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/embeddings`. For more details, refer to [Configurations ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/configuration/open-ai-compatibility/).

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `text` one of required

    * `0` string min 1

      The text to embed

    * `1` array

      Batch of text values to embed

      * `items` string min 1

        The text to embed

  * `pooling` string default mean

    The pooling method used in the embedding process. \`cls\` pooling will generate more accurate embeddings on larger inputs - however, embeddings created with cls pooling are not compatible with embeddings generated with mean pooling. The default pooling method is \`mean\` in order for this to not be a breaking change, but we highly suggest using the new \`cls\` pooling for better accuracy.

* `1` object

  * `requests` array required

    Batch of the embeddings requests to run using async-queue

    * `items` object

      * `text` one of required

        * `0` string min 1

          The text to embed

        * `1` array

          Batch of text values to embed

          * `items` string min 1

            The text to embed

      * `pooling` string default mean

        The pooling method used in the embedding process. \`cls\` pooling will generate more accurate embeddings on larger inputs - however, embeddings created with cls pooling are not compatible with embeddings generated with mean pooling. The default pooling method is \`mean\` in order for this to not be a breaking change, but we highly suggest using the new \`cls\` pooling for better accuracy.

### Output

* `0` object

  * `shape` array

    * `items` number

  * `data` array

    Embeddings of the requested text values

    * `items` array

      Floating point embedding representation shaped by the embedding model

      * `items` number

  * `pooling` string

    The pooling method used in the embedding process.

* `1` object

  * `request_id` string

    The async request id that can be used to obtain the results.
