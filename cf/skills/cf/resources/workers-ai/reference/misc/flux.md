Automatic Speech Recognition • Deepgram

@cf/deepgram/flux

Flux is the first conversational speech recognition model built specifically for voice agents.

| Partner | Yes |
| Real-time | Yes |
| Unit Pricing | $0.0077 per audio minute (websocket) |

## Usage

Step 1: Create a Worker that establishes a WebSocket connection

```ts
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    const resp = await env.AI.run("@cf/deepgram/flux", {
      encoding: "linear16",
      sample_rate: "16000"
    }, {
      websocket: true
    });
    return resp;
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Step 2: Deploy your Worker

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

Step 3: Write a client script to connect to your Worker and send audio

```js
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://<your-worker-url.com>');


ws.onopen = () => {
  console.log('Connected to WebSocket');


  // Generate and send random audio bytes
  // You can replace this part with a function
  // that reads from your mic or other audio source
  const audioData = generateRandomAudio();
  ws.send(audioData);
  console.log('Audio data sent');
};


ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  // Transcription will be received here
  // Add your custom logic to parse the data
  console.log('Received:', event.data);
};


ws.onerror = (error) => {
  console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
};


ws.onclose = () => {
  console.log('WebSocket closed');
};


// Generate random audio data (1 second of noise at 44.1kHz, mono)
function generateRandomAudio() {
  const sampleRate = 44100;
  const duration = 1;
  const numSamples = sampleRate * duration;
  const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(numSamples * 2);
  const view = new Int16Array(buffer);


  for (let i = 0; i < numSamples; i++) {
    view[i] = Math.floor(Math.random() * 65536 - 32768);
  }


  return buffer;
}
```

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `encoding` string required

  Encoding of the audio stream. Currently only supports raw signed little-endian 16-bit PCM.

* `sample_rate` string required

  Sample rate of the audio stream in Hz.

* `eager_eot_threshold` string

  End-of-turn confidence required to fire an eager end-of-turn event. When set, enables EagerEndOfTurn and TurnResumed events. Valid Values 0.3 - 0.9.

* `eot_threshold` string default 0.7

  End-of-turn confidence required to finish a turn. Valid Values 0.5 - 0.9.

* `eot_timeout_ms` string default 5000

  A turn will be finished when this much time has passed after speech, regardless of EOT confidence.

* `keyterm` string

  Keyterm prompting can improve recognition of specialized terminology. Pass multiple keyterm query parameters to boost multiple keyterms.

* `mip_opt_out` string default false

  Opts out requests from the Deepgram Model Improvement Program. Refer to Deepgram Docs for pricing impacts before setting this to true. https\://dpgr.am/deepgram-mip

* `tag` string

  Label your requests for the purpose of identification during usage reporting

### Output

* `request_id` string

  The unique identifier of the request (uuid)

* `sequence_id` integer min 0

  Starts at 0 and increments for each message the server sends to the client.

* `event` string

  The type of event being reported.

* `turn_index` integer min 0

  The index of the current turn

* `audio_window_start` number

  Start time in seconds of the audio range that was transcribed

* `audio_window_end` number

  End time in seconds of the audio range that was transcribed

* `transcript` string

  Text that was said over the course of the current turn

* `words` array

  The words in the transcript

  * `items` object

    * `word` string required

      The individual punctuated, properly-cased word from the transcript

    * `confidence` number required

      Confidence that this word was transcribed correctly

* `end_of_turn_confidence` number

  Confidence that no more speech is coming in this turn
