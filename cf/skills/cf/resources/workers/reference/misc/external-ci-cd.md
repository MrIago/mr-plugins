# External CI/CD


Deploying Cloudflare Workers with CI/CD ensures reliable, automated deployments for every code change.

If you prefer to use your existing CI/CD provider instead of [Workers Builds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/), this section offers guides for popular providers:

* [**GitHub Actions**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/external-cicd/github-actions/)
* [**GitLab CI/CD**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/external-cicd/gitlab-cicd/)

Other CI/CD options including but not limited to Terraform, CircleCI, Jenkins, and more, can also be used to deploy Workers following a similar set up process.
